# Install single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. Kubernetes provides an abstraction layer to actually orchestrating experimentation resources (all the way from containers, CPU, memory up to programmable NICs, GPU, even external resources).

This document describe how you can create a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your computer using a virtual machine! You will need the following requirements:

- virtual machine running Debian stable (example: Debian 12). Basic installation without any graphical interface is fine (only select the taskel "standard system utilities"). 

- the VM should have 4GB of RAM

- the VM should have 4 vCPUs

- the VM should have 20GB of disk space

- the VM should have Internet access
